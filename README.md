# How the Movie Recommendation App Works

1. User Input:
The user selects their preferred Genre, Duration, and Mood from dropdown menus.

2. Form Submission:
Upon clicking the "Get Recommendation" button, the app filters a predefined list of movies based on the selected preferences.

3. Recommendation:
The app displays a movie that matches the selected criteria, showing the title, genre, runtime, and mood.
If no match is found, a message is displayed indicating that no movie matches the preferences.

4. Error Handling:
If an error occurs, a relevant message is shown to the user.
The app provides an easy way to get personalized movie suggestions based on your mood and time.


# Challanges I have faced

1. Getting the movie details
2. Making the UI
3. Getting movie data from assets.js to app.js
